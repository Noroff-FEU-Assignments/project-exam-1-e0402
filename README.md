## Description

ARTrospective is my first year exam project at Noroff. In this project exam we were tasked with creating a blog website, with a topic of our choosing. We were asked to use Wordpress as a Headless CMS, creating the content of the blog posts there and making a call to to the Wordpress REST API. In addition we were asked to create the front end of the website, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The ARTrospective blog is a fictional blog run by three art historians passionate about making art history available to everyone.
